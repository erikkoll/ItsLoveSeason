    <!-- Story Event: Meeting on Teams (text then image) -->
    <section class="story-event">
      <div class="story-text">
        <p class="event-caption">
           It all began on a warm summer afternoon in Barcelona. The temperature was perfect and the city was alive with energy. 
        But that's not where the main characters were. One was in rainy London, and the other had woken up at 3am in pretty Flower Mound, Texas.
        And they were both, (un)fortunately, on <strong>Microsoft Teams</strong>.

    <p class="event-caption">
      It took them until spring 2021 to meet in person, when both relocated to London.  
      They did their first trip together (as friends) on the last day of August  
      to the coastal town of Hastings. They were having fish & chips and chilling  
      in the grass, unaware that millennia ago some important events took place that 
      would shaped the course of the country’s history:

<!-- Story Event: Realising their feelings in Italy -->
<section class="story-event">
  <div class="story-text">
    <p class="event-caption">
      Over two years, their friendship grew as they spent more time together.  
      It wasn’t until a trip to Italy with friends in April 2022 that they realised  
      they might be interested in more. This realisation may have been aided by   
      a night in a club and a bottle of strong Sambuca…

      In October 2022, an opportunity to move in together came when one of 
      Gabriela's flatmates moved out. They decided to take it and started
      living together in a Clapham flat with friends Marco and Phoebe.

      When it was time to find their own place one year later, they moved into 
      a cozy flat with a garden just 10 minutes down the road and within a quick 
      walk of several friends' places.They still live in that same flat and love 
      the community they’ve built!
